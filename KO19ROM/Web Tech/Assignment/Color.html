      <h1>Exploring Our Solar System</h1>
    
      <p>
        The solar system consists of the Sun and all the objects that orbit it,
        including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
      </p>
      
    </header>

    
    <div>
      
      <h2>The Inner Planets</h2>
    
      <p>
        The inner, rocky planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They are
        relatively small and dense.
      </p>

    
      <section>
    
        <p>
          Earth, our home planet, is unique for its liquid water and
          life-supporting atmosphere.
        </p>
        
      </section>
      
    </div>

    
    <p>
      The Asteroid Belt lies between Mars and Jupiter and contains millions of
      rocky fragments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are gas giants
      (except Uranus and Neptune which are ice giants) and are much larger than
      the inner planets.
    </p>

    
    <div>
      
      <h2>The Outer Planets</h2>
      
      <p>
        These planets are known for their size, rings (in the case of Saturn,
        Uranus, and Neptune), and numerous moons.
      </p>
      
    </div>


    <p>
      Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region containing icy bodies,
      including dwarf planets like Pluto.

      <h3>Understanding Our Cosmic Neighborhood</h3>
    
      <p>
        Studying the solar system helps us understand planetary formation and
        the potential for life beyond Earth.
